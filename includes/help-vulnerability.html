<p>
  This vulnerability index is given by the following equation:

  $$V = {{a + b + c} \over {{2a + b + c} \over 2}} - 1$$

  with,
  <b><em>a</em></b>, the number of predators-preys interactions occurring during both baseline and future periods;
  <b><em>b</em></b>, the number of predators-preys interactions occurring only during the baseline period;
  <b><em>c</em></b>, the number of predators-preys interactions occurring only during the future period; <br />

  This index reflects the vulnerability to climate change for terrestrial ecosystems of the tundra of the Nunavik based on predators-preys interactions dissimilarity.
